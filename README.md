# Bookworm

A program for book categorization, precompiled for Windows but with support for all Python-supported platforms. Supports Polish and English languages.

# Why I made this
I wanted to make a simpler program than the ones available in Polish.

## Requirements  
- Python 3.x (tested on Python 3.13)  
- Runs on Linux (tested on Ubuntu Linux, though lacks some functionality) and Windows (tested Windows 11)
- Python libraries from requirements.txt 

## Installation  
***On Windows:*** just run the .exe installer, then run Bookworm executable.
<br>
<br>***On Linux:*** 
1. Make a Python 3.13 virtual environment
2. Run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
3. Run program .py

## How it Works 
User can add, modify or search books in .xlsx file using Bookworm. Deleted books are stored into a seperate list.

## Instructions
Planning on making an instruction written in Markdown, both for users and for developers.

## Roadmap / Future Enhancements  
- more efficient language support (not hardcoded)
- passphrase for password recovery
- program update system based on Github releases
- QoL fixes (will add more as I use the program more)
