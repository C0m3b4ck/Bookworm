# Why I made this
I wanted to make a simpler program than the ones available in Polish.

## Requirements  
- Python 3.x (tested on Python 3.13)  
- Runs on Linux (tested on Ubuntu Linux) and Windows (tested Windows 11)
- Python libraries from requirements.txt 

## Installation  
On Windows: just run the .exe
On Linux: 
1. Make a Python 3.13 virtual environment
2. Run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
3. Run program

## How it Works 
User can add, modify or search books in .xlsx file using Bookworm. Deleted books are stored into a seperate list.

## Roadmap / Future Enhancements  
- adding more color themes
- more efficient language support (not hardcoded)
- program update system
